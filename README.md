# JavaHttpServer
a shopping list website written in JavaSE. Sockets, CGI


This project used MVC structure.
Shopping.java is the main enterance.
MainController.java is a kind of CGI which assigns requests to corresponding Accessables. An accessable is a page controller. It processes requests and respond with Pages which output HTML pages.

## Uploaded executable files
I used Chinese in the program so it needs UTF-8 charset to display correct contents.
Run Shopping.jar with java commands: java -Dfile.encoding=utf-8 -jar Shopping.jar or use my batch file Launcher.bat.
